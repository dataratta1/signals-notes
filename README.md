# dataratta – Signals & Notes

This repository contains raw notes, early signals, and pattern observations
collected from public data, platforms, and ongoing trends.

The goal is not prediction,
but documentation of what appears early before it becomes mainstream.

## What this is
- Early trend observations
- Weak signals and emerging patterns
- Notes curated from multiple sources

## What this is not
- Financial advice
- Predictions or guarantees
- Polished research reports

## How this connects to Dataratta
Some of these notes may later appear as visual explanations,
short videos, or summarized insights across platforms.

This repository acts as the raw layer behind that content.
